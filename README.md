## Project Status

⚠️ **Development Preview** 
- This is currently in active development and not yet a production/use-ready. 
- Features and code are being added and refined. (Code still trash and very desorganized)

## Objective

EDPA is designed to assist Commanders engaged in PvE piracy by analyzing systems within a specified range of a reference system. The tool uses a scoring system to identify the most profitable piracy targets based on:

- **Economic factors** (Industrial, Refinery, High Tech economies)
- **Government types** (Anarchy, Feudal, Corporate, etc.)
- **Security levels** (Anarchy, Low, Medium, High)
- **Population demographics**
- **Faction states** (Boom, Civil Unrest, War, etc.)
- **Market demand** for valuable commodities
- **Presence of planetary rings**

## Features

### Current Features
- **System Analysis** - Scoring of systems for piracy viability
- **Customizable Search Radius** - Search within 10-200 LY of any reference system
- **Weighted Scoring System** - Configurable weights for different economic and political factors

## Using

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- EDSM API Key ([Get one here](https://www.edsm.net/en/settings/api))

### First-Time Setup
- TODO
